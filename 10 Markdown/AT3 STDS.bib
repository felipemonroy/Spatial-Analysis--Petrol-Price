The test is applied to data concerning the so-called Swedish asphalt cartel, which was discovered in 2001. Using information on submitted bids and procurement characteristics for both the cartel period (1995\textendash 2001) and the post-cartel period (2003\textendash 2009), the Moran's I correctly predicts complementary bidding behavior for linear and quadratic specifications when such behavior is likely to exist, and rejects such behavior when it's unlikely to be present. Remarkably, the Moran's I also correctly indicates and rejects complementary bidding on the basis of information on the separate bids alone.},

  abstract = {Present methodological research on geographically weighted regression (GWR) focuses primarily on extensions of the basic GWR model, while ignoring well-established diagnostics tests commonly used in standard global regression analysis. This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local GWR coefficients at a single location and the overall correlation between GWR coefficients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coefficients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these findings, applied GWR research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local GWR coefficients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the GWR multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coefficient dependency issues in GWR. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.},
